## 📊KPI(Key Performance Indicator) 
- Test Case Execution Rate Formula: Executed Test Cases / Total Test Cases × 100 Purpose: Shows how much of the test suite was executed. 
- Defect Detection Percentage (DDP) Formula: Number of Defects Found / Total Defects (Found + Missed) × 100 Purpose: Measures how effective your test cases are. 
- Automation Coverage Formula: Automated Test Cases / Total Test Cases × 100 Purpose: Shows how much of the project is automated. Example: You automated Login, Signup, Scroll Tests, Cart, Products Page. 
- Test Case Pass Rate Formula: Passed Test Cases / Executed Test Cases × 100 Purpose: Shows stability and quality of the system. 
- Script Stability Rate Formula: (Number of Successful Automation Runs / Total Automation Runs) × 100 Purpose: Tells how stable your automation scripts are (no flakiness). 
- Defect Leakage Formula: Defects found after testing / Total defects × 100 Purpose: Shows your testing effectiveness before release. 
- Average Execution Time Formula: Total Duration of Automation Run / Number of Test Cases Purpose: Helps measure performance and optimize automation speed. 
- Reusability Percentage Formula: Reusable Functions / Total Functions × 100 Purpose: Shows how reusable your automation framework is (e.g., Login function, WebDriver factory, BaseClass). 
- Bug Severity Index Formula: (Weight of all found defects) / Total defects Example weight: Critical = 4 High = 3 Medium = 2 Low = 1 Purpose: Shows the seriousness of bugs detected.
